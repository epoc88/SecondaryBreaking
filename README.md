# Secondary Breaking Dataset
This dataset consists of over 4700 images collected from the field test site at the mobile lab of Tampere University.
All images were acquired from a ZED stereo camera with resolution of 1280x720, which took more than two weeks of hard work.
Data annotation took another 2 weeks.

If you use the data for your publication or other commerical purpose, please kindly cite the following papers:
